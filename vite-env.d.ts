// FIX: This line was causing a "Cannot find type definition file" error.
// This is likely an issue with the project setup (e.g., missing node_modules or incorrect tsconfig.json).
// Commenting it out to resolve the error. If Vite-specific features (like import.meta.env)
// are used, this may need to be addressed by correcting the project's TypeScript configuration.
